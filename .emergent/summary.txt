The AI engineer's work primarily focused on resolving persistent Vercel deployment issues, enhancing the application's branding, implementing a comprehensive luxury theme, and ensuring full mobile responsiveness. Initially, the engineer tackled  and React version conflicts during Vercel builds, along with output directory misconfigurations, which required iterative adjustments to , , and the build process. Once deployment stability was achieved, the focus shifted to refining the user experience. This included updating SEO metadata, integrating a new Ailutions SVG logo across headers and footers, and configuring a modern favicon. A major aesthetic overhaul was then executed, applying a Luxury White + Minimal Grid Theme throughout the site, carefully preserving a specific Business Reality Check section as requested. Mobile responsiveness was meticulously addressed, fixing button overflows, text wrapping, and layout inconsistencies. Finally, a detailed button styling system and precise text color palette were implemented, culminating in the standardization of a single Modern Blue Gradient for accents and icon coloring. The trajectory concludes with the AI mid-action, building the application to test these latest aesthetic changes.

The user tasked the AI with building a conversion-optimized React/FastAPI/MongoDB website for Ailutions. The site features a Hormozi-style homepage, Digital Maturity Tracker, ROI Calculator, Automation Readiness Assessment, and Conversational Contact Form, all designed for lead generation with professional PDF report generation and direct booking options. Design guidelines emphasize agency-quality UI/UX, layered design, specific fonts (DM Sans, Inter), a black/white/blue/green/mint color scheme, responsive design, micro-animations, and Shadcn UI.

Post initial build, the engineer addressed Vercel deployment stability, then focused on branding and aesthetics. This included updating the meta title and description, removing an Emergent badge, integrating a new Ailutions SVG logo (header, footer, favicon), and applying a Luxury White + Minimal Grid Theme (with a specific Business Reality Check section's content preserved, though its background was updated). Mobile responsiveness was a critical requirement, ensuring all elements fit screens across devices. A refined button styling system (primary black, secondary light gray, accent with blue gradient) and a precise text color palette (headings pure black, paragraphs medium gray, sub-headlines dark gray) were then implemented, with a final instruction to standardize on a single blue gradient for accents and icon colors.

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the implementation of the new button color system, gradient standardization, and icon color updates as per the latest user request.
- Verify that the secondary button text color is updated from black to the secondary color.
- Ensure only one specific gradient is used consistently for text and background accents.
- Set icon colors as specified by the user.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of applying the latest comprehensive styling update regarding button colors, gradient consistency, and icon colors. The user explicitly requested: if there is a secondary button change it from black to the secondary color. also stick to only one gradiant in text, bg color, set the icons as mentioned above in color.

To address this, the engineer has already performed the following actions:
1.  Edited  to update CSS rules for button styles.
2.  Added new icon color classes (, ) to .
3.  Standardized the gradient usage across the site by modifying  to primarily use the Modern Blue Gradient ( to ) and removed the Rose to Amber gradient for CTAs.
4.  Updated CSS variables in  (, ) to reflect the single consistent gradient.
5.  Modified  to remove the old gradient definitions and integrate the new, standardized gradient colors.
