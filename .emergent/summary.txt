<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive, conversion-optimized full-stack application for Ailutions. Starting from a basic landing page with a contact form and a Digital Maturity Tracker, the engineer iteratively enhanced the UI/UX, incorporating advanced design principles like animated gradients, parallax effects, and interactive components. Key features added include an ROI Calculator, a multi-step conversational contact form, and an Automation Readiness Assessment tool, all with lead capture, PDF report generation, and direct booking options. The product matured into a powerful lead-generation system. The current work involves troubleshooting deployment to Vercel, specifically resolving a  dependency conflict encountered during the  step.

<product_requirements>
The user aims to build a conversion-optimized website for Ailutions, an AI automation company, focusing on generating leads and demonstrating value. The application is a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB setup.

**Key Features Implemented:**
1.  **Homepage:** Initially a simple layout, evolved into a Hormozi-style conversion-optimized page. It features a hero section with animated gradients and parallax AI graphics, a credibility bar, interactive service cards with hover effects, case studies with interactive flip cards, a How It Works section, a blog insights preview, an About section, and a comprehensive footer.
2.  **Digital Maturity Tracker:** An interactive multi-step quiz assessing a business's digital transformation readiness across six categories. It provides an overall maturity score, category breakdowns, personalized recommendations, a professional PDF report download, and direct call booking/WhatsApp contact options on the results page.
3.  **ROI Calculator:** A tool for users to input business metrics (employees, salary, hours, automation %, cost, industry) to calculate potential financial impact from AI automation. It provides detailed results (ROI, payback period, annual savings, hours saved), a professional PDF report, and direct booking options.
4.  **Automation Readiness Assessment:** An interactive worksheet allowing users to input repetitive tasks (Decision/Task, Who, Frequency, Tools Used, Time Spent). It auto-calculates an automation potential score, visualizes top repetitive tasks, generates a PDF report with ranked automation priorities, and offers specific implementation guides for each identified task, along with lead capture via email.
5.  **Conversational Contact Form:** A multi-step form for lead capture, integrated with WhatsApp for quick contact.
6.  **PDF Reports:** All three assessment tools generate branded, professional, multi-page PDF reports that visually match the web UI, containing detailed analysis, recommendations, and action plans.

**Design Guidelines:** Agency-quality (0,000+), conversion-optimized, Jasper.ai-inspired, layered design, glass-morphism, emotional impact, clear messaging, intuitive navigation, DM Sans and Inter fonts, black/white/blue/green/mint color scheme (avoiding dark/prohibited gradients), responsive design, micro-animations, scroll-reveal, ample whitespace, Shadcn UI components.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database.



-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The main entry point for the React application, handling global routing () and integrating core components. It was updated extensively to include routes for , , and , and to render the various homepage sections.
-   **/app/frontend/src/data/mock.js**: This file was initially created and used to provide mock data for frontend components (e.g., service cards, case studies) before backend integration. It was updated as new sections and tools were added.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/DigitalMaturityTracker.jsx**: Implements the multi-step digital maturity assessment. It was initially a frontend-only mock, then enhanced for PDF report generation and direct booking functionality.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/ROICalculator.jsx**: Implements the interactive ROI calculation tool. This file was created to handle user inputs, perform calculations, and trigger PDF report generation.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/AutomationReadinessAssessment.jsx**: Implements the interactive worksheet for identifying automation opportunities. It includes input tables, a scoring engine, visual analytics, lead capture, and detailed PDF report generation with automation guides.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/\*.jsx**: Numerous custom React components were created (e.g., , , , , , , ) to build the modular and feature-rich UI, adhering to Shadcn UI and custom styling.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css, /app/frontend/src/index.css, /app/frontend/tailwind.config.js**: These files define the global styling, custom animations, typography, color palette, and Tailwind CSS configuration, crucial for achieving the agency-quality and Hormozi-style visual design.
-   **/app/frontend/package.json**: Manages frontend dependencies and build scripts. It has been updated multiple times to include new libraries, fix  build commands, and address dependency conflicts during Vercel deployment attempts.
-   **/app/backend/server.py**: The FastAPI application entry point. It defines API routes (prefixed with ), handles MongoDB connections, and includes basic CRUD endpoints (e.g., ). It was modified to be compatible with Vercel's serverless function handler.
-   **/app/vercel.json**: This configuration file defines how Vercel should build and deploy the monorepo application, including build commands, output directories, and routing rules for both frontend and backend. It has been modified repeatedly during the deployment troubleshooting process.
-   **/app/DEPLOYMENT.md**: A markdown file created to provide detailed, step-by-step instructions for deploying the application to Vercel, including necessary environment variables and dashboard settings.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of debugging and fixing Vercel deployment issues for the full-stack Ailutions application. The website, including the homepage, ROI Calculator, Digital Maturity Tracker, and Automation Readiness Assessment tools, is fully functional in its local development environment with professional UI/UX, PDF generation, and lead capture features.

The initial deployment attempt to Vercel failed with a  error, which was addressed by correctly configuring Vercel's Root Directory to  and updating build commands.

Following this fix, a new Vercel deployment error emerged during the  phase. The error message indicates a dependency conflict:  requires  version , but the project's  specifies . The AI engineer's last action was to attempt to resolve this dependency conflict by modifying the  file.
